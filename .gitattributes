# This git configuration file transforms file encoding. Rules follow the order in which they are defined. 
# Generic rules like "**" are overridden by specific rules like "**.md".
# On USS, encoding information is stored in a file's tag. Use the cmd "ls -lasT" to show the "T" Tag.

# ** This is a generic rule for all files (*) to convert ASCII (UTF-8) to zos-compatible (IBM-1047) EBCDIC.
#    This includes all application source code across all (**) folders
